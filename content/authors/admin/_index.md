Hello, world! I am Wenxuan Zhang, a data science practitioner with experience in marketing, advertising and retail industry. I am passionate about using data to solve practical business problmes including:

* What creative copy is the most effective in driving brand awareness?
* Would the incremental investment in tik tok generate more conversion?
* Which customer is more likely to buy our products?

you name it. 

I am also an archer and when I am not crunching data or coding, you might find me shoot arrows in the archery club.
